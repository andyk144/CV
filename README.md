## Andrew Kemp

After ten successful years working in the insurance industry, I wanted a new challenge and decided it was time for a change. Having been responsible for system development in my previous role, I'd had exposure to the role of a developer and this was something that intrigued me. As a creative individual, the thought of taking an idea and bringing it to life through code is exciting and something I wanted to do. 

Since March 2018, I have been studying at Makers Academy, an intensive, 16 week, development bootcamp. 

## Skills

#### Communication

Throughout my career I've had the opportunity to develop excellent communication skills; be it, explaining a product to a customer, motivating and driving my team to achieve a particular target or delivering a change proposal to senior management. I am comfortable communicating with stakeholders on all levels.  

#### Analytical thinker

During my role at LV, I analysed claims data on a daily basis to help improve department performance. Through my attention to detail and self management, I was able to spot trends, bottlenecks and potential problems in advance, implementing changes and improvements where necessary.

#### Team-player

I am an enthusiastic, highly motivated individual who enjoys working as part of a team. From my previous roles, I am comfortable leading a team, with the ability to motivate and inspire others. 

#### Fast learner

I am always striving to learn new skills and develop myself as an individual.
