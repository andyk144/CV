I'm a full-stack software developer with a passion for cutting edge technology and a thirst for knowledge and self-improvement. I recently completed an intensive coding bootcamp at Makers in London. During the 16 week course, I developed my technical skills, teamwork and communication skills. I particularly enjoyed coding in an environment where the focus was developing a best-practice approach.

I am looking for a role where I can apply and grow my skillset whilst working as part of a dynamic team.

## Projects

During my time at Makers, I worked on many projects, both independently and in pairs/teams. The projects below are the ones I'm most proud of, and I believe they showcase the progress I have made throughout the Makers course.

## Experience

#### Student at [Makers](https://makers.tech/)

At Makers I learned a mix of technical and soft skills. My work has mainly centred around Ruby and Javascript projects, moving from simple CLI apps to full stack apps hosted on Heroku. Every step of the way, I have focused on TDD and XP values, ensuring I maintain high code quality and work seamlessly with other people. Whilst working as part of a team I ensured we employed the Agile methodology for rapid continuous improvement.

**Key skills:** software craftsmanship, communication, problem solving, fast learning

#### Commercial Claims Team Leader at [LV=](https://www.lv.com/)

As Commercial Claims team leader, I was responsible for the day to day management of a team of 11 Commercial Claims handlers. This included motivating and guiding the team, alongside driving individual development for each team member through personally tailored plans. As part of this role I was responsible for system improvement, which required me to work closely with the in-house dev team. My tasks, in this respect, included making requests, seeking senior management approval, testing and overseeing the implementation of changes.

**Key transferrable skills:** teamwork, communication, decision making, stakeholder and dev team management

#### Commercial Claims Handler at [LV=](https://www.lv.com/)

Responsible for validating, negotiating and settling Commercial claims up to the value of £125k. in addition to claims handling, I was responsible for producing a monthly claims reports for a number of key brokers, which involved a large volume of data analysis to highlight any key trends.

I also led relationship development with a number of key insurance brokers and Commercial loss adjusters.

#### Home Claims Handler at [RBS](https://personal.rbs.co.uk/personal/insurance/home-insurance.html)

Responsible for validating, negotiating and settling Commercial claims up to the value of £10k. This involved constant communication with customers to manage claims through to a satisfactory conclusion for all parties, which often involved explaining complicated insurance terminology/conditions to customers in a way they could fully understand.

On occasions, this role involved complaint handling which involved keeping calm under pressure and elements of problem solving to find amicable solutions.
